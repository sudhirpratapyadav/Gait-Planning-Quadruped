# Gait-Planning-for-Quadruped
This projects is about building quadruped and planning its gait. Matlab simulation (both stick-figure and 3D Simulink) of Crawl-Gait was done. It involved solving Kinematics equations and accordinlgy paln trajectory for each leg.
Finally ROS was used to control actual Quadruped and Crawl Gate was used for walking.
Kindly read documentation and look at videos of simulation to get more Idea about project.
